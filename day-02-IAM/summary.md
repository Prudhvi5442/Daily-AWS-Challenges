## üìò Topics Covered (Udemy ‚Äì Section 4)

- What is IAM and why it's critical in AWS
- IAM Users, Groups, and Roles explained
- IAM Policies: Inline vs Managed
- MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) setup
- IAM Best Practices for secure access
- Permissions boundaries and policy JSON structure
- Hands-on: Creating users, groups, roles, and attaching policies

## ‚úçÔ∏è Key Concepts

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: A secure way to control user access to AWS resources.
- **User**: Represents a person or app that interacts with AWS services.
- **Group**: A collection of IAM users that share the same permissions.
- **Role**: Assigned to AWS services or trusted users, used for temporary access.
- **Policy**: A JSON document that defines permissions.
- **MFA**: Adds extra security by requiring two methods of verification.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Done

- Created an IAM user with specific permissions
- Assigned the user to a group with managed policies
- Enabled MFA on the user
- Created a custom policy using JSON
- Explored IAM roles and trust relationships

## üß† Learnings & Reflections

IAM is the foundation of AWS security. It was exciting to manually create users and experiment with policy boundaries and role-based access. Understanding how to restrict permissions at a granular level helped solidify my knowledge of secure AWS design.
